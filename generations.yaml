    description: "The first-generation Toyota ist was introduced in Japan as a compact hatchback with distinctive boxy styling targeting young urban buyers, later exported to North America as the Scion xA and to China as the Toyota Zelas. Based on the same platform as the contemporary Yaris/Vitz but with a more substantial body design, the ist featured a tall, upright profile maximizing interior space within compact exterior dimensions. Powered by a 1.3-liter or 1.5-liter VVT-i engine in the Japanese market, paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, the ist offered modest but adequate performance for urban environments. The interior emphasized versatility with rear seats that could slide, fold, or be removed entirely, creating a flat cargo floor when needed. Despite its compact dimensions, the ist provided relatively spacious accommodations for passengers due to its efficient packaging and tall roof. Equipment levels were good for its segment, with features like automatic climate control, power accessories, and a premium audio system available. The ist established itself in the Japanese market as a practical, stylish compact car appealing particularly to younger buyers seeking versatility and distinctive design in a small package, while serving as one of the initial offerings for Toyota's youth-oriented Scion brand in North America."

  - name: "First Generation (XP60 Facelift)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The first-generation Toyota ist received a significant facelift on May 30, 2005, introducing revised exterior styling with updated front and rear bumper designs, new headlights, and an updated grille. The interior received minor revisions including new trim options and updated equipment availability. After the facelift, the ist was only available through Toyota's Netz Store dealerships, replacing the previous availability at both Netz and Toyopet stores. The mechanical specifications remained largely unchanged, continuing with the 1.3-liter and 1.5-liter VVT-i engine options paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The facelifted model maintained its position as Toyota's youth-oriented compact hatchback, serving as the basis for the Scion xA in North America. The distinctive boxy styling was softened slightly while maintaining the tall, space-efficient profile that maximized interior volume within compact exterior dimensions."

  - name: "Second Generation (XP110)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2016
    description: "The second-generation Toyota ist featured more refined styling with a less boxy, more dynamic appearance while maintaining the practical, space-efficient design philosophy of its predecessor. Based on an updated version of Toyota's small car platform shared with the contemporary Yaris, the new ist grew slightly in all dimensions offering improved interior space and comfort. Engine options in the Japanese market continued with 1.5-liter and 1.8-liter VVT-i units, paired with a Super CVT-i (Continuously Variable Transmission) replacing the previous conventional automatic, providing improved efficiency and smoother operation. The interior saw significant improvements in design and material quality, with a more upscale appearance and enhanced feature content including available smart key entry and start, automatic climate control, and enhanced audio systems. Safety features expanded with standard ABS, multiple airbags, and available stability control on higher grades. The versatile rear seating arrangement continued with 60:40 split folding capability, though without the removable function of the previous generation. This generation was exported to North America as the Scion xD, replacing the xA, though with some design and equipment differences from the Japanese ist. The second-generation ist continued to appeal to urban buyers seeking a practical, versatile compact car with distinctive styling and good feature content, remaining in production in Japan until 2016 when it was effectively replaced by the more crossover-oriented Toyota C-HR, reflecting the market shift toward SUV-like vehicles even in the compact segment."
